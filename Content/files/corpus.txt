These Partners might include (depending on what services you use): your TV or internet service provider, or other streaming media device providers who make our service available on their device; mobile phone carriers or other companies who provide services to you and collect payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us or provide pre-paid promotions for the Netflix service; and voice assistant platform providers who enable interaction with our service through voice commands.

For example, we use such information to: determine your general geographic location, provide localized content, provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies and TV shows we think will be of interest to you, determine your ISP to support network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated ISP information for operational and business purposes), and help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests; coordinate with Partners on making the Netflix service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the Netflix service, based on the specific relationship you have with the Partner; secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of Netflix accounts; prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which Netflix signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular device is permitted to use the account consistent with our Terms of Use); analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery; communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about Netflix, details about new features and content available on Netflix, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with operational requests such as password reset requests. These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described below). Please see the &quot;Your Choices&quot; section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences and to learn more about matched identifier communications. Our recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at www.netflix.com/recommendations. Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect and use it. We will normally collect personal information from you where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for example, to provide our services to you), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (for example, our direct marketing activities in accordance with your preferences), or where we have your consent to do so (for example, for you to participate in certain consumer insights activities like specific surveys and focus groups). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, to prevent payment fraud or confirm your identity). Please visit our Help center article at www.netflix.com/uk-eea-legalbases for more information about this topic. For questions about our use of your personal information (including legal bases and transfer mechanisms we rely on), cookies or similar technologies, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office by email at privacy@netflix.com. Please visit our online help center at help.netflix.com for more information about these topics. We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below: The Netflix family of companies: We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo) as needed for: providing you with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement. Service Providers: We use other companies, agents or contractors (&quot;Service Providers&quot;) to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we engage Service Providers to provide marketing, advertising, communications, security, infrastructure and IT services, to customize, personalize and optimize our service, to provide bank account or balance information, to process credit card transactions or other payment methods, to provide customer service, to analyze and enhance data (including data about users&#x27; interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which includes maintaining and improving their services). Partners: As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service to members and providing information about the availability of the Netflix service. For example, depending on what Partner services you use, we may share information: in order to facilitate Partner pre-paid promotions or collection of payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us; with Partners who operate voice assistant platforms that allow you to interact with our service using voice commands; so that content and features available in the Netflix service can be suggested to you in the Partner’s user interface. For members, these suggestions are part of the Netflix service and may include customized and personalized viewing recommendations. Promotional offers: We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. Please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices. Protection of Netflix and others: Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law. Business transfers: In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement. Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection. Specifically, we use a variety of contractual, organizational and technical protections as appropriate for such transfers, including data protection agreements/standard contractual clauses (available for review here); technical protections such as encryption, and practices to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests. You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways: certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device; social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and through Netflix game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards. Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy. “Remember me” function: For ease of access to your account, you can use the &quot;Remember me on this device&quot; function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. Giving others access to your account: If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address or other information in the &quot;Account&quot; area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the Wi-Fi network to which you are connected. If you use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices. Profiles: Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy)). We have various parental controls available, you can learn more by reading our Help article located at https://help.netflix.com/node/264. Removing device access to your Netflix account: To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices, visit the &quot;Account&quot; section of our website, choose &quot;Sign out of all devices,&quot; and follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information. Email and Text Messages.

If you subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device&#x27;s settings functionality to turn them off. We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off. WhatsApp. If you have enabled WhatsApp messages in connection with your Netflix account or profile and no longer wish to receive them, you can use your WhatsApp app settings to block them. Interest-Based Ads. Interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from Netflix, please see the &quot;Cookies and Internet Advertising&quot; section (below). Matched Identifier Communications. Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website. You can request access to your personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information we hold about you. You may also request that we delete personal information that we hold about you. When you visit the &quot;Account&quot; portion of our website, where you have the ability to access and update a broad range of information about your account, including your contact information, your Netflix payment information, and various related information about your account (such as the content you have viewed and rated). You must be signed in to access the &quot;Account&quot; section. If you are the account owner, to download a copy of your personal information go to: www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo (you must be signed in to access the &quot;Account&quot; section), and follow the instructions.

For more information about how to access your information, including our verification process, please reference this help article: help.netflix.com/node/100624. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information; if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time; withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. For information on how to stop certain uses of your personal information, please reference this help article: help.netflix.com/node/100637. Please also see the &quot;Your Choices&quot; section of this Privacy Statement (above) for additional choices regarding your information. You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. Our main establishment within the European Union is in the Netherlands. Please visit our online help center at help.netflix.com for more information about these topics. Retention of information: We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. Specifically, we retain information for our legitimate interests and essential business purposes, such as operating, maintaining and improving our services; complying with our legal obligations; and exercising our legal rights and remedies, including enforcing our terms of use. Our retention of information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, are you a Netflix current member); the nature of the information; compliance with our legal obligations; defending or resolving actual or anticipated legal claims. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required. For information about deletion, removal and retention of information, please reference this help article: help.netflix.com/node/100625. We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information. The Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service. You must be at least 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Netflix service. Minors may only use the service with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian. We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take effect) in accordance with law. Your continued use of the Netflix service after any such updates take effect will constitute acknowledgement and (as applicable) acceptance of those changes. If you do not wish to acknowledge or accept any updates to this Privacy Statement, you may cancel your use of the Netflix service. To see when this Privacy Statement was last updated, please see the &quot;Last Updated&quot; section below. We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use. Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies. If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the &quot;Identifier for Advertisers&quot; (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the &quot;Google Advertising ID&quot; on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes. Why does Netflix use these technologies? We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud; to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites. To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below: Essential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service. Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors&#x27; use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service. Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers: These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes. These types of ads are called &quot;interest-based advertising.&quot; The advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers. In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively “Advertising Partners”), may receive limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information). Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service. Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user. Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service. How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies? To exercise choice regarding cookies For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here. At this time, we do not respond to web browser &quot;do not track&quot; signals. To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;ads&quot; in your device&#x27;s settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests. To exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising: In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) To exercise choice regarding other technologies There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser&#x27;s help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application. To see the prior version of this document, please go to www.netflix.com/privacyupdates.

Offer eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netflix membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to you. Billing and Cancellation 3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the Netflix service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the &quot;Account&quot; page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the &quot;Billing details&quot; link on the &quot;Account&quot; page to see your next payment date. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party. 3.2. Payment Methods. To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details. 3.3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the &quot;Account&quot; page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). 3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused Netflix content. To cancel, go to the &quot;Account&quot; page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click &quot;Billing details&quot; on the &quot;Account&quot; page. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party. 3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. Netflix Service 4.1. You must be at least 18 years of age to become a member of the Netflix service. Minors may only use the service under the supervision of an adult. 4.2. The Netflix service and any content accessed through the service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household. During your Netflix membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Netflix service and Netflix content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the service for public performances.4.3. You may access the Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content. The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the &quot;Account&quot; page.4.4. The Netflix service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our websites, user interfaces, promotional features and availability of Netflix content. You can turn off test participation at any time by visiting the &quot;Account&quot; page and changing the &quot;Test participation&quot; settings. 4.5. Some Netflix content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices (&quot;Offline Titles&quot;). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles may not be playable in certain countries and if you go online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that country. 4.6. You agree not to archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) content and information contained on or obtained from or through the Netflix service. You also agree not to: circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the Netflix service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Netflix service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Netflix service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the Netflix service in any way; or use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method. In addition, you agree not to upload, post, e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with the Netflix service, including any software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs. We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the service. 4.7. The quality of the display of the Netflix content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD and HDR, and not all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all formats. Default playback settings on cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content. The minimum connection speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). A download speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching Netflix content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and the configuration of your Netflix ready device. 4.8. Netflix software is developed by, or for, Netflix and may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access Netflix content through Netflix ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices. You acknowledge that the use of the service may require third party software that is subject to third party licenses. You agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the Netflix software and related third-party software. Passwords and Account Access. The member who created the Netflix account and whose Payment Method is charged (the &quot;Account Owner&quot;) is responsible for any activity that occurs through the Netflix account. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the Netflix ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. We can terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, Netflix or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Miscellaneous 6.1. Governing Law. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. These terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your country of residence. 6.2. Unsolicited Materials. Netflix does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for Netflix content, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to Netflix. 6.3. Customer Support. To find more information about our service and its features or if you need assistance with your account, please visit the Netflix Help Center, which is accessible through the netflix.com website. In certain instances, Customer Service may best be able to assist you by using a remote access support tool through which we have full access to your computer. If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent to support through the remote access tool, and we will assist you through other means. 6.4. Survival.

Blog ||| Arial [x][x] Verdana ||| Dan Flying Solo | Travel Blog &amp; Travel Photographer Hey, I&#8217;m Dan! Obsessed with exploring the world, meeting new people and getting as lost as possible with my camera. I was on the road for 1467 days between 2014 &#8211; 2018, taking a chance on changing my career from restaurant manager to capturing the world and somehow it all worked out&#8230; I&#8217;m now starting a new chapter living in Portugal. I hope this site gives you some inspiration (and handy tips) to go and chase your own adventures. Travel is the best kind of education so go get lost, even if it&#8217;s just outside your own doorstep! Dramatic rugged mountains touching the clouds, hills covered in banana plantations, ocean as far as the eye can see, majestic waterfalls, hikes along waterways&#8230; Madeira offers the ideal island escape, a perfect part of Portugal to explore! If you are heading to Madeira, consider staying at the idilic Quinta Saraiva, shown in this video &#8211; you can get a discount on your booking via the code on my Portugal Blog &#8211; link and review here! Remote, wild, and untouched &#8211; all travel cliches, yet perfectly describe this remote cluster of islands just above Antartica. The penguins are the main draw, but what else is there to do in the Falkland Islands? Later, when I would meet Binna and learn about his Port Douglas, I’d think back to these modern and contemporary canvases. “We are proud of our past” he would say, “But this artwork is about now, it’s about me, my stories”.

Blog ||| Arial [x][x] Verdana ||| Who is Dan Flying Solo + Get in Touch | Travel Photographer &amp; Blogger …In Short: I&#8217;m obsessed&nbsp;with exploring the world, meeting amazing people (and goats) and getting as lost as possible with my camera. I was on the road for 1467 days between 2014 &#8211; 2018, taking a chance on changing my career from restaurants to capturing the world and somehow it all worked out… … The long one: Welcome to my little corner of the WWW. Dan here, and I guess this is the place where I tell you about how I gave up my high flying corporate job because I hated the cubicle and sold it all to travel the world and chase this blogging dream…. but that wouldn’t be true for a few main reasons:&nbsp; 1-I had nothing to sell, and more debt than savings 2-I was a restaurant manager 3-I never planned or wanted to be a blogger But, nearly five years on here I am, still travelling, although not full time anymore (I managed about 1500days before making some more permanent roots again &#8211; Portugal now being home) and somehow, I guess, a ‘professional blogger’ among other things. Those other things being a photographer, travel writer, creative director at my media company in Portugal, videographer, and whatever else I find myself doing in the wacky world of travel. Just a quick lowdown on my travel style and what to expect on this site: a bit of everything. Sometimes I book fancy hotels cause I want a treat, other times I go camping and eat noodles for days on end with a paintbrush because I forgot chopsticks or a fork. There’s not one particular theme to this blog because I don’t think that’s how life really is, we change and what we enjoy changes. I try and focus on good value travel, which doesn’t always mean cheap, it means getting the most out of what you spend and the trip you plan, and although I don’t have a goal to visit every country in the world, I’m interested in a huge variety of cultures and countries, so this blog doesn’t focus on one particular continent for example.&nbsp; Travel for me is about education and the people I meet&nbsp;always make the trip, that&#8217;s why I usually like to fly solo &#8211; it makes it heaps easier to connect with the locals and get an inside look at a destination and you&#8217;ll most likely find me lost somewhere, camera in hand trying to blag my way through a conversation in a language I don&#8217;t really get &#8211; if you see me, come say hi :) So, what do you want to know? I always find these about me pages a bit weird to write but hey, one slightly boring biography coming up. I was born in the U.K., and although I always had an obsession with planes and aviation, I didn’t really take a gap-year, and it wasn’t until my early 20s that I really discovered travelling. Anyhow, this blog was born in 2013, I think, mainly to write really crappy articles, add a few semi-bad photos, and keep my family informed on my little weekend trips. Not that they actually read it they have since admitted, so I’m not sure who those 18 monthly visitors were. Back then, I was challenging myself to make two-day trips to Europe for £100 all in, flights, accommodation, the lot, to break up the crazy working hours of being a waiter.&nbsp; Somehow I’ve grown from those 18 people to over a million page views a year &#8211; something I still can’t believe and I’m genuinely grateful that people come to visit this site, especially the patient ones who read this long-winded, slightly pointless, and non-sensical page.&nbsp; So in 2014, I quit my job as a restaurant manager in London, it was a great busy restaurant and one of the coolest spots in London. I didn&#8217;t quit because I hated it, but curiosity of what else was out there had got the better of me. It was September, and I didn’t really have enough money in my current account (4000 GBP) and also had a fair bit of credit card debt too (update, August 2019, I’m just about to clear it!). I then met someone and fell in love the month before my one-way ticket to Indonesia. So, I did the sensible thing and got on the plane and hoped for the best, both in love, money, and Bali-belly.&nbsp; I was Dan, I was flying, and I was solo &#8211; and that’s how the lamest blog name ever was born. The next four years were a whirlwind; I travelled to some 50 countries, that love decided to move to the other side of the world to be together. Australian visa dramas followed and breakups happened, I started freelancing for Lonely Planet, got a photographer job at a tour company, did a poll on the internet of whether I should drag my heartbroken ass to move to New Zealand or Scotland in 2017. New Zealand won, so dutifully I got on a flight on December 31st and moved there. Want to know what happens on a China Eastern flight at midnight on New Year’s Eve? Nothing, they turned the lights off at 11.50, and that was goodnight. I didn’t love living in New Zealand as it was a bit far away from home, and decided I couldn’t waste any more time or emotion or money on trying to get back to Australia, so I went and visited some friends in Portugal, they gave me countless cocktails, I ended up behind the bar mixing messy drinks and the next day I went and filled out some forms and because a resident. Which unrelatedly happened to help with the old Brexit situation too. Woohoo. I&#8217;ve lived in UK, Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and now Portugal. How did I get into this travel photography business? I was continually trying to learn new skills when I first started travelling as a) I didn’t want to rush back and b) my money wasn’t going to last long, especially with my credit card minimum payments. I started with photography and web design, did lots of free online course and watched YouTube, and gradually developed a skill set that gave me a new opportunity, which was great, as I was broke AF and had gone back to London for two months with a temporary job at my old workplace. This is getting a bit rambly now, and I’m writing it from the middle seat of a Wizz Air flight to Kyiv, which is my least favourite place to write from, so I’ll wrap it up with some favourites/FAQs as it’s likely no one is reading this far anyway… What camera do I use?&nbsp; I shoot with a Canon 5Dii which is second hand, and the make is 11 years old &#8211; so I don’t think you need the newest and best gear to get into photography. I actually had all my gear stolen a few years ago (so get insurance kids) and that was the replacement camera I could afford at the time. I’m about to get the Sony a7RIV as I&#8217;m doing way more video work now &#8211; but the best camera for starting with is the one you have in your hand!&nbsp; How do I get into blogging?&nbsp; I don’t have an article or anything about getting into blogging or tips for starting out, other than that random mess of words above, partly because I want my site and traffic to stay focused on places and people, not me, but mainly because as you can see, I have no actionable tips except save up more money than I did, keep learning always, and only do what you are passionate about or creativity will dry up and you’ll end up hating what can be a not overly well-paid job. Do travel photographer because you love it, not because you want free trips!&nbsp; My friend Janet has one of the best posts on this subject though, and she’s still a hardcore travelling loving legend through and through so go check her post on being a blogger out for more answers.&nbsp; Also I LOVE getting messages, comments and emails from you guys about places etc. &#8211; but I get about 50 a week about how to do this as a job, and I’ve really not got much to say on the matter as you can see, it’s a trial and error for everyone &#8211; this is how I started working with Lonely Planet though.&nbsp; Favourite people, I’ve met on my travels, because there the most important moments.&nbsp; Simla &#8211; an absolute legend who gave me my first pro photographer job at her tour company. Survived a brain haemorrhage and went on to build a pretty amazing empowerment tourism company. Her story is pretty incredible. Binna &#8211; one of the nicest guys ever, I first met him on a Lonely Planet video shoot in Queensland Australia I was presenting, when I was asked to make a promo video for Three Mobile and LP in Australia, and they gave me full range of any Australian experience I could pick, and I chose the Aboriginal art and culture, as I don’t think enough visitors to Australia give this time. Binna was a legend, showed me his local area of Mossman and Port Douglas, and then we met again a year later when I suggested to Simla she made a tour to discover the Aboriginal heritage of tropical North Queensland which she did, amazing.&nbsp; Sonu &#8211; from Delhi for all the amazing work she does in the slums there creating school places for kids. Amanda &#8211; in New Zealand who reached out on Instagram when she saw I was moving there and became a great friend, and even let me housesit &#8211; I’ll always appreciate Amanda and her friendship! Nicki &#8211; who I also met on Instagram and then somehow we were on a camping trip in Oman, no idea how that happened, and now I’m on route to Tajikistan to meet her &#8211; though pretty sure this Trek will be the last thing my body can handle right now. Anyway, she rocks, and blos about off the beaten path spots. The dude sat next to me on my flight right now handing me Haribo &#8211; what a legend. I speak zero Ukrainian, so don’t have a name, but anyone that shares their Haribo deserves a shout out. Ahhh there are so many more amazing people, but my fingers are hurting from typing this on the phone so will come back and finish this later (narrator: he never did).&nbsp;&nbsp; Favourite cities and why:&nbsp; Lisbon &#8211; it’s sexy, it’s cool, it’s Portuguese, and it’s soon to be my home. Honestly, there’s something about those cobbled streets that makes me grin and love life.&nbsp; Sydney &#8211; loved living here, city and beach combine together, and the quality of life is pretty decent here. Rio &#8211; absolutely one of the best trips of my life and also my first trip outside of Europe/USA &#8211; I went with friends from work in London who are dancers ith the samba schools, and we hopped between the different dance schools in the favelas and I even got to dance down the samba drone at carnival. It was a trip with its heartbreaking challenges, but absolutely amazing and I have to credit my two dear friends who took me, the English village boy under their wing and shared their culture and country with me so openly and thoroughly, without them and this trip I don&#8217;t know how I would view and understand the world, but their education is pricesless and I will always be greatful to them. Bologna in Italy, can’t pinpoint it but I could easily live here and slowly turn into a big fat piece of pasta.&nbsp; Sarajevo &#8211; the culture and history and cake and people and just everything. It’s not the most beautiful of cities but damn its amazing. Edinburgh &#8211; Scottish people, Festivals, culture and those Scottish accents! St Petersburg &#8211; so much beauty and personality, went as part of a cruise but must go back!&nbsp; Favourite countries in no particular order: (of the 67ish I’ve been to)&nbsp; Portugal Bosnia and Herzegovina Italy Indonesia Slovenia&nbsp; Oman Dominica (not the Dominica republic) Sri Lanka Australia Mauritius&nbsp; Favourite travel story: When Lilly got the car stuck on a hill in Albania, and the policeman and she had a hand-language playoff Camping in Oman with Nicole and Jeremy and we sneak into a beach resort and then our camper stove blows up alerting everyone to our presence. Also when I got my goat selfie there. Filming in the mangroves of Queensland with the LP film Crew and their faces when Binna started talking about the crocodiles. Going to India with Janet and Vicky and basically sitting on a bus for the whole four-day trip and then getting stuck on a boat and missing the main part of the festival we were there for &#8211; such a delirious mess of a trip but I kind of cherish it as it was an epic experience, and what I briefly did experience of the worlds largest human gathering (50 million + people) was epic and otherwordly, The Kumbh Mela. Meeting another Dan in a smoking room in Myanmar, and then reconnecting later because the Mayor of Ljubljana has shared one of my articles and he recognised it was me. The whole shit show which was my trip to Thailand, my first to Asia and we ended up ditching it and going to Indonesia instead as it was such a comedy of errors. It’s where my love of Indo comes from, and I have Louise to thank for that. All those stories, including an unfortunate incident with the Big Mac, are thankfully in a journal and not online. Oh man, so many more, so many of them not even on the blog yet &#8211; I get distracted my travelling and living in the moment and then forget actually to write about the trip.&nbsp; Okay, we’re about to land in Ukraine, and it’s 3 am, so that’s it for the about me page that it will likely take another four years to update. so this random pile of meh will sit here for a while. I’ve booked a hotel here based entirely on the fact the carpets are the most garish I’ve ever seen, so got that to look forward to before Nicki kills unfit me on this Tajik trek! And someone even asked for my middle seat and gave me an aisle so they could sit next to their wife, what a legend! Thanks for reading, I hope you find some helpful stuff here (on the blog, certainly not this page), and find me on the socials if you want irregular updates on my travels Instagram | Facebook | YouTube | Twitter Safe travels! Dan&nbsp; Ps. I’ll re-read this one day and wonder what kinda sleep-deprived rant I was on…&nbsp; [&#8230;] Daniel James, with his amazing writing and photography skills, useful traveling tips, and earnest passion for traveling is a perfect example when it comes to successful content creating in the travel affiliate marketing niche. [&#8230;] &#8230;and I&#8217;m obsessed with getting lost in new places and meeting new faces. From remote Atlantic Islands full of Penguins, to bustling Italian cities crammed with amazing architecture. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to turn my passion for travel and photography into my job, and spent four years travelling full time before settling down in Portugal &#8211; a far cry from the life I thought I would have when I left my London restaurant managers job. This website is full of my favourite places and people, and stories from the road &#8211; I hope it can help you explore the world a little bit better through tips, advice, and personal stories. Safe travels!
